                <h2>CHARLIE CURTIS</h2>
                  <p>
                    Charlie is CrossFit Level 1 Certified and is also certified as a Personal Trainer through NCCPT.  He also holds his Level 2 Coaches Prep, and CrossFit Football Certifications.
              		<br /><br />
              		Charlie played Division 1 football at Rice University until he transferred to Georgetown University where he completed his athletic and academic career.
              		<br /><br />
              		Charlie is an independent personal trainer and loves working with his clients to help them reach their fitness goals.  Through his own experience and the experiences of his clients he has found CrossFit to be the most efficient and most rewarding fitness program out there and has set his sights on sharing CrossFit with the Downtown LA community.
              		<br /><br />
              		 He is interested in training for and competing in the CrossFit Games as well as the local competition circuits.  He wants everyone to see and feel the benefits of superior health and fitness and hopes The Rec Center will be the platform on which he can share CrossFit with the surrounding community!

            <h2>ERIKA CURTIS</h2>
            Erika holds a CrossFit Level 1 certification, and has been an avid CrossFitter since 2009.
            <br /><br />
            She danced as a kid and throughout college but it was CrossFit that brought out her inner athlete! She truly believes that it is a program that can be for everyone no matter what sort of shape you start out in... from the hardcore competitive athlete to someone who has never stepped into a gym... CrossFit is for YOU!
            <br /><br />
            Both Erika and Charlie live in  and love the "hood" of the Arts District and love being a part of this awesome community! When Erika isnt coaching classes, or CrossFitting... she is busy being a mom to her new baby boy: "Ace Curtis" :)
